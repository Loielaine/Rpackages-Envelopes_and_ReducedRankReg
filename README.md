### Reference

This project is based on a research paper: [Envelopes and reduced-rank regression](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17Tea5P7hLxhBQg8eK8dWJHTD6pBzXmVb/view?ts=5bcf5334). 


### Description

In multivariate regression analysis there is the case in which the coefficients matrix is not full rank. In such cases the reduced-rank methodology can get a better estimate than OLS.
