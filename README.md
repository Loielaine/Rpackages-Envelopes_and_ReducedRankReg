### Reference

This project is based on a research paper: 
R. Dennis Cook, Liliana Forzani, Xin Zhang; Envelopes and reduced-rank regression, Biometrika, Volume 102, Issue 2, 1 June 2015, Pages 439–456, https://doi.org/10.1093/biomet/asv001


### Description

In multivariate regression analysis there is the case in which the coefficients matrix is not full rank. In such cases the reduced-rank methodology can get a better estimate than OLS. Another improvement that can be done in multivariate analysis is when the estimation of the beta matrix can be done with less information without compromissing accuracy. For this, we look a subspace in which the projection the response is independent of the covariates. The envelope regression methodology estimates this subspace and also outperforms OLS. In this project we build a program that combines reduced-rank and envelope regression methodologies. Each of the methodologies don't compite with each other since they solve different challenges. It is because of this that the combine methodology outperforms OLS, reduced-rank and envelopes.

### Data simulation
 
Now we compare the performance of our Reduced-rank envelope regression model with those of other methods (OLS, Reduced-rank regression and Envelope regression). To compare the model performance, we can consider not only assessing the fit of models, but also calculating the running time of the code. Here we just compare the fit between the models since we are going to examine the running time at the benchmark test part.

First, we generated virtual datasets. Data was generated by three different combinations of parameters: (d, u, p, r) = (1, 10, 10, 20), (4, 5, 6, 20) and (5, 10, 15, 20). In addition, we also generate data by different sample size (N=160, 270, 450, 740, 1200, 2000). After generating the virtual datasets, we did the modeling with our new Reduced-rank envelope package and existing R packages (for OLS, Reduced-rank regression and Envelope regression). We calculated ‖β ̂-β‖_F for assessing the averaged estimation error of models, and Figure X.1 is the result plot.

As we can see from the plot, our Reduced-rank envelope regression model always showed the best performance in all the three cases. In addition, it is also impressive that Reduced-rank envelope was stable between different sample sizes from 160 to 2000. In particular, it is noteworthy that in a small sample size, its performance was superior to other methods.

### Choose d and u

When you have a data, our package can recommend the parameter d and u for a reduced-rank envelope regression modeling based on the error calculation. When you input the matrices of X, Y and the real Beta (the left case of below figure), the function 'choose_du' calculates  ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cleft%20%5C%7C%20%5Chat%7B%5Cbeta%7D-%5Cbeta%20%5Cright%20%5C%7C_F), while it calculates ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?AIC%20%3D%202N_%7BRE%7D%20-%202L_%7Bu%2Cd%7D%20%3D%20%28p&plus;r-d%29d&plus;r%28r&plus;1%29/2%20-%202%5Chat%7BL%7D_%7Bu%2Cd%7D) when you input the matrices of X and Y without the real Beta matrix (the right case of below figure).

The function 'choose_du' returns not only the heatmap but also the best combination of (d,u) based on the calculated errors.
