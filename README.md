This project is based on a research paper: 
R. Dennis Cook, Liliana Forzani, Xin Zhang; Envelopes and reduced-rank regression, Biometrika, Volume 102, Issue 2, 1 June 2015, Pages 439â€“456, https://doi.org/10.1093/biomet/asv001


### Description

In multivariate regression analysis there is the case in which the coefficients matrix is not full rank. In such cases the reduced-rank methodology can get a better estimate than OLS.
